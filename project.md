	<div class="description" > I designed an algorithm that generates art based on global frequency of colors. <br>
    The algorithm is applying the following two steps alternatively to a randomly initialized image: <br>
    1. gradient ascend steps of maximizing the frobenius lp norm of the image <br>
    2. 1-d guassian filter centered at 0 on each row and columns of the image <br>
    The philosophy of this abstract idea is captured through a quote from the <i>The Winter of Our Discontent</i> by John Steinbeck: <br>
  <i>A surge of wave pushed me against the very back of the Place. And the tempo of the sea speeded up. I had to fight the water to get out, and I had to get out. I rolled and scrambled and splashed chest deep in the surf and the brisking waves pushed me against the old sea wall. </i>

  <div class="description" > <i>Emotional Printer</i> is an installation that converts "text" into "color" in real time using big data and machine learning. The real-time update is fast enough that it reacts as soon as you type in a new letter. The idea behinds the project is an attempt to visualize "emotion", an extremely complciated concept in a highly abstract way.

  <div class="description" > <i>Trapped</i> is a story created using RPG Maker MV. The perspective as abuser is usually left out compared to the perspective as victim. Of course this is not defend the abuser. But the fear made it's really hard for the abuser to make any voice. Practically, this makes it very difficult for them to get help in the early stage. I mean how do you treat a patient without the patient being diagnosed? And how would you diagnose a patient if the patient don't talk? This game is the exploration of this topic.
