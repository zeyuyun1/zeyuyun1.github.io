<p>This will be in the lecture, in the note, everywhwere. But make sure you can write induction principle on your own and understand how this transforms into “proof by induction”:</p>

<p>Formal definition:</p>

<p>Induction Principle: \(P(1) \wedge (P(n) \implies P(n+1)) \implies \forall n \in \mathbb{N} P(n)\)</p>

<p>Essentially, we can expand “\(P(n) \implies P(n+1)\)”, as the following chain of implication is true:</p>

\[P(1) \implies P(2) \implies P(3) \implies P(4) ...\]

<p>Since this chain of implication is true, if we know P(1) is True as well, then P(2) is True. Since P(2) True, then P(3) is True…</p>

<p>It is just like a sequence of domino tiles, we now know every P(n) is true!</p>

<p>This is formally why induction is true!</p>

<p>In fact, Induction Principle directly comes from “Well Ordering Principle” of integers, which is very nonempty subset of integers has a smallest or least element. In fact, you can prove “Well Ordering Principle” implies “Induction Principle”.Hint:[Use proof by contradiction and consider the set \(n \in \mathbb{N} P(n)\) is False]. I will leave this as a daily excercise to you!</p>

<h3 id="induction-not-only-on-natural-number">Induction not only on Natural number:</h3>

<p>Can you do induction some set other than natural number? Absolutely, for example, consider the set \(3\mathbb{Z}^{+}+1\) := {\(k \in \mathbb{N} \| 3k + 1\)}</p>

<p>If we expand it out, it becomes {1,4,7,10,13,16 …}</p>

<p>In order to do induction on this set, we need change our base case and induction hypothesis a little bit. We need to have \(P(1)\) as base case and \(P(n) \implies P(n+3)\) as induction hypothesis instead. Can you see why? I think this is already a big hint for you homework problem so I’ll say no more. I’ll explain more on this in the modular arithmetic chapter!</p>
