<p>I got asked by this a lot: How do you prove “If P then Q”? You might encounter this question even bofore taking this class. And you probably know what to do, but don’t know why.</p>

<p>“I can first assume P is true, and prove Q is true as well”</p>

<p>YES! This is right procedure, your proof goes:</p>

<p>”
Assume P is True,</p>

<p>Some proofs…</p>

<p>Conclude Q is true
“</p>

<p>But do you know why I don’t you need to consider the case when P is False? After all, you just learnt “prove by cases”, there’s two cases for P, it can either be True or False. So why don’t we need to consider the case when P is False?</p>

<p>There’s two way to explain the answer:</p>

<p>First, the intuitive way:</p>

<p>Consider this implication “If there’s a wild fire, the school will shut down.” When will this statement will false? It’s when in reality, there’s a wild fire, but school does not shut down. What if there’s no wild fire in the first place, then the school might not shut down due to other reason like the coronavirus. No matter what, it cannot prove the statement “If there’s a wild fire, the school will shut down.” is True or False. In other words, it’s irrelevant to the statment.</p>

<p>Next, the mathematical way, make sure, make sure you understand this, in fact, if you do, then your understanding is already above the curve:</p>

<p>Consider the Truth table for “If P then Q” aka, \(P \implies Q\)</p>

\[\begin{array}{C|C|C|}
P &amp; Q &amp; P\implies Q \\
\hline
\color{red} T &amp; \color{red}T &amp; \color{red}T \\
T &amp; F &amp; F\\
\color{red}F &amp; \color{red}T &amp; \color{red}T\\
\color{red}F &amp; \color{red}F &amp; \color{red}T
\end{array}\]

<p>How do we prove \(p\implies q\) is true? We only need to consider the above three line that’s colored in red in the true table, which are all related to \(p \implies q\) being True. If we assume P is False, that goes to the the last two line, no matter what Q is, P will be True. If we assume P is True, we need to prove Q is true in order for \(P\implies Q\) to be True. That’s why we don’t bother to assume P is False. That’s why the general proving technique is:</p>

<p>”
Assume P is True,</p>

<p>Some proofs…</p>

<p>Conclude Q is true
“</p>
