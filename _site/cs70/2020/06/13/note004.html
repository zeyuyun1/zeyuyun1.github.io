<p>For this chapter I think you really need to read the notes, not all the them, but if a theorem appears in the lecture. You should go back to find the proof for that theorem in the note and see if you understand it. A lot of you might ask if you need to remember the proofs. I will say, if you want an A, then the answer is Yes. However, remember the proofs does not mean reciting the proofs words for words, but remembering the most important line of the proof. I call this the “Leap of the Faith”. Here’s some example:</p>

<h1 id="theorem-51-eulers-theorem-1736-an-undirected-graph-g--ve-has-an-eulerian-tour-iff-g-is-even-degree-and-connected-except-possibly-for-isolated-vertices">Theorem 5.1 (Euler’s Theorem (1736)): <em>An undirected graph G = (V,E) has an Eulerian tour iff G is even degree, and connected (except possibly for isolated vertices)</em></h1>

\[\Rightarrow\]

<p>For a tour, we can imagine we removed an edge once we walked on it. For each vertex, the tour must go in and out. Since no edge is repeated, we remove two degree from the vertex each time. Eventually, we removed even number of degree for each vertex.</p>

\[\Leftarrow\]

<p>Make a tour, still imagine we removed the edge that we walked on. Since every vertex has even degree, we must pass through every vertex and eventually comeback to the starting point. Repeat until we get an Eulerian tour.</p>
