network"
  authors: "Zeyu Yun and Bruno Olshausen"
  abstract: "We applied the principles of sparsity and slowness to build representations for natural scenes. Then used coupled Hopfield network dyanmic to learn motion patterns and shape patterns."

- title: "Natural retinal cone distributions emerge from
optical and neural limits to vision"
  authors: "Yazhou Zhao*, Zeyu Yun*, Ruichang Sun, and Dasheng Bi"
  abstract: “We model visual system with a CA-constrained optical simulation and designed a learnable cone mosaic sampling. We show that the model’s emerged cone mosaic resembles a cone mosaic found in humans, when optimized for both spatial acuity and color acuity”

- title: "Transformer visualization via dictionary learning:
contextualized embedding as a linear superposition of transformer factors"
  authors: "Zeyu Yun*, Yubei Chen*, Bruno Olshausen, Yann LeCun"
  abstract: "We used sparse coding to visualize Large Language Models (LLMs). By adopting neural computation principle, we greatly improve the interpretability of LLMs. Our result implies  LLMs compute in a manner akin to the human brain, where it builds representations to predict upcoming language at multiple levels of abstraction."
